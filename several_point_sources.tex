\section*{Several Point Sources With Different Boundary Conditions}
When solving the Helmholtz equation with several point sources, it is possible to see the interference between the different sources. In figure \ref{fig:severalSourcesDBC3D} the two sources are located in (-0.25, -0.25) and (0.25, 0.25) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We can see the constructive interference in the origin. The Robin boundary conditions will produce figure \ref{fig:severalSourcesRBC2D} and figure \ref{fig:severalSourcesRBC3D}. Here the point sources are located in (-0.25, -0.25), (0.0, 0.0) and (0.25, 0.25). The interference is clearly shown here as well, and we can see the middle peak's intensity is larger than at the location of the other sources.
