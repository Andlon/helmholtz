\section*{Several Point Sources}
When solving the Helmholtz equation with several point sources, it is possible to see the interference between the different sources. In figure \ref{fig:severalSources} the two sources are located in (-0.25, -0.25) and (0.25, 0.25) and we can see the constructive interference in the origin.
