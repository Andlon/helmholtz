\section*{Single Source In Unit Box}
In this simple example we model a single source located in the origin of a unit box with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this solution we have used 1000 points in each spatial direction. A grid as fine as this shows very clearly the source in form of a spire located in the origin. We can also see the symmetry of the solution.
